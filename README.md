 Moving Average Crossover Trading Bot

This repository contains the code for a Moving Average Crossover Trading Bot designed for the MetaTrader 5 platform, written in MQL5. The bot automates trading decisions based on the crossover of two smaller moving averages (MAs) with a major MA, a classic strategy in technical analysis.

 Project Overview

The bot aims to capitalize on potential market trends indicated by the MA crossovers. It's designed to execute trades when both smaller MAs cross above or below the major MA, indicating bullish or bearish market conditions, respectively.

 Features

- MA Crossover Strategy: Implements a dual moving average crossover strategy.
- Customizable MA Periods: Users can define their own periods for the major and smaller MAs.
- Risk Management: Includes basic risk management features like stop-loss.
- Backtesting: Code structured for easy backtesting with MetaTrader 5's Strategy Tester.
- Live Trading Capability: Ready for live trading on the MetaTrader 5 platform.
